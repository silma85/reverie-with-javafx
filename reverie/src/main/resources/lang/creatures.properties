# Creatures have effects based on their presence. Primarily, a description (.ambience) maybe different based on behaviour (.ambience.scared/angry/friendly).
# In this game we cannot die, lucas-style, so no creature can harm us. But it can scare us away.
# Effects are:
# 	making us retreat into another room (.effect.room)
# 	making us lose some object(s) (.effect.steal)
#	making some object(s) appear (.effect.give)

# Creatures can become scared/angry/friendly based on whether we have or not some item(s) and it is flipped or not, or we do actions.
